This is quite a detailed and specific request and it will require some organization and scripting to achieve. Here is a basic outline of how you could structure this:

**Directory Structure**

You can organize your files by topic, with each topic in its own directory, and a main .tex file in each directory for that topic.

```
root
│
└───topic1
│   │   main.tex
│   │   other.tex
│   
└───topic2
    │   main.tex
    │   other.tex
```

**Makefile**

You can use a Makefile to automate the process of building the PDF. For simplicity, let's assume that you are passing the topic names as arguments to `make`. 

```make
all: $(addsuffix .pdf,$(TOPICS))

%.pdf: 
	pdflatex -output-directory $(@:.pdf=) $(@:.pdf=)/main.tex
	mv $(@:.pdf=)/main.pdf $@
```

In this Makefile, `$(TOPICS)` is a variable that represents the list of topics you provide. The `$(addsuffix .pdf,$(TOPICS))` construct appends `.pdf` to each item in the list, so `$(TOPICS)` should be a list of directory names.

You can run this Makefile with a command like `make TOPICS="topic1 topic2"` to build the PDFs for topic1 and topic2.

**Referencing Sections**

For your requirement of having Topic A reference a section of Topic B only if Topic B is included in the PDF, LaTeX does not inherently support conditional referencing like that. A workaround could be to include all references in each document, but then use a custom command to display them. You could define this command in such a way that it only displays the reference if the referenced document is included in the PDF.

For example, you could define a command `\maybereference` in your preamble:

```latex
\newcommand{\maybereference}[2]{
\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{\includedtopics}}{
\ref{#2}
}{}
}
```

In this command, `#1` is the name of the topic of the reference and `#2` is the label of the reference. `\includedtopics` is a list of the topics included in the PDF. You would set this variable in the main .tex file for each topic, before including the other .tex files.

With this command, when you want to reference a section in another topic, instead of using `\ref{label}`, you would use `\maybereference{topic}{label}`. If the topic is not in the list of included topics, the reference will not be displayed.

Please note that this is a simplified example and might need to be adjusted based on the specifics of your project and setup. Also, the Makefile example assumes that you're using pdflatex and that your main .tex file for each topic is named `main.tex`. If your setup is different, you'll need to adjust the Makefile accordingly.
