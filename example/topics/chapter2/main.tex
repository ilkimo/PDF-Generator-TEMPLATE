\section{Chapter 2}
Under Adrian's patient guidance, Leo painstakingly carved the scroll, cut out the f-shaped sound holes, and applied layer upon layer of varnish to his instrument. Adrian watched as Leo, with his youthful energy and earnest determination, breathed life into a piece of wood.

Finally, the day came when Leo strung up his violin for the first time. As he tightened the strings, a sense of anticipation filled the room. Adrian, his face showing a mix of pride and curiosity, handed Leo a bow. Leo placed the bow on the strings, drew a deep breath, and pulled. The sound that filled the room was pure and clear, bringing an instant smile to Leo's face and tears to Adrian's eyes.

From then on, Leo's life changed. He not only worked in Adrian's shop but also started playing the violin on the streets of Corvinus. His music - beautiful and heart-touching - earned him a little money, which he saved for his family. His music brought a touch of beauty to the busy city streets and drew people from all walks of life to stop, listen, and enjoy the moment.

Meanwhile, Adrian's health started declining. Even though he was growing weaker, his spirits remained high, and his love for the craft never diminished. Leo, noticing this, started taking over more responsibilities in the shop, becoming less of an apprentice and more of a successor.

One cold winter's day, Adrian did not come to the shop. Worried, Leo rushed to Adrian's house to find him bedridden, a shadow of his former self. Yet, Adrian greeted Leo with a smile. "My time has come, Leo," he said in a weak voice, "but I'm not sad. I see the future of violin-making in good hands." Leo held Adrian's hands, tears streaming down his face. The following week, Adrian passed away, leaving Leo and the city in deep mourning.
