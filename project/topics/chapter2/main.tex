\section{The Test}
A month had passed since Ben and Wendy's meeting. Their bond had grown from casual chats into something more profound. They shared dreams, fears, and whispered secrets that the walls of the kitchen bore witness to.

Then, the day of the big summer party arrived. Mrs. Harper was hosting a feast for her friends. The kitchen bustled with activity. The sight of the chopping board sent a wave of panic through the fruit bowl. One by one, fruits were taken, never to be seen again. Ben and Wendy huddled together, their stems trembling.

"Ben," Wendy whispered, her voice shaky, "I'm scared. What if we are chosen next?"

"It's okay, Wendy. Whatever happens, we're in this together," Ben said, offering what comfort he could. Their reality was harsh, but they found strength in their shared vulnerability. The room filled with laughter and the clinking of dishes, oblivious to the silent promises exchanged in the fruit bowl.

As the evening wore on, Mrs. Harper reached for the fruit bowl one last time, her hand hovering over Ben and Wendy. She hesitated for a moment before picking up Wendy, leaving Ben behind. His heart sank as Wendy was taken away. Wendy, on the other hand, felt a pang of sorrow as she saw Ben for what she believed could be the last time.

However, instead of the chopping board, Wendy found herself placed as the centerpiece on the dinner table, surrounded by an array of dishes. She was relieved, yet her heart ached for Ben. In that moment, she realized her love for him was deeper than she had thought. The distance between the table and the kitchen counter felt like a million miles.

Meanwhile, Ben was left alone, the happiness in his heart replaced with dread. As he sat in the empty fruit bowl, he realized the depth of his feelings for Wendy. She was more than a friend; she was his solace, his anchor. He loved her. But was it too late to tell her?
